	<p>Syracuse University knows how to appeal to the public. From its modern-day, state-of-the-art classrooms, to world renowned programs in every field; it is obvious why the school draws in nearly fifteen thousand students for its undergraduate programs and nearly five thousand for post-grad. Students can bond over supporting the same sports teams, taking the same classes, and living in the same dorms- it truly is a small paradise located in Upstate, New York. However, many people fail to recognize the struggling city around it.</p>
	<p>Ronzelle Walker, a Syracuse City resident explains the difference between living in Syracuse and living at Syracuse University, Syracuse. When it’s in-season, Ronzelle works as a construction associate. By paving streets in the neighborhoods, Ronzelle has a better understanding of the city and its problems. His weekend job is working as a bouncer at the near-campus bar, Harry’s. Through having this occupation over the past five years, Ronzelle has seen into the lives of Syracuse University students and how they differ so much from his young adulthood.</p>
	<p><strong>“It’s a completely different lifestyle,” He says.</p></strong>
	<p>Ronzelle explains that the students who go here are privileged.</p>
	<p><strong>“Not in a bad way, it’s just how we were raised. It’s different.”</p></strong>
	Ronzelle explained that he sees students at the University driving cars he “knows” the students didn’t pay for. He also then discussed what the school does for the community.
	<p><strong>“Well, the sports bring a great sense of community to the city. Everyone I know gets dressed up and goes crazy for the games. It’s one of the few times the city and students are one giant family.”</p></strong> 
	<p>However, Ronzelle most emphasized problems that many Syracuse residents deal with daily. Poverty and crime. The city of Syracuse has a 32.6% poverty rate- as compared to the national average is 11.5%. Ronzelle notes that this problem affects the community greatly- noting that this is another example of how Syracuse students and Syracuse residents are completely different. Furthermore, a 2020 study showed that Syracuse leads the nation in child poverty with an astounding 48.4%.</p>
	<p><strong>“I bet most of these kids had their parents buy their cars,” He says. “And that’s not to fault anyone, but just to further show our differences- my dad gave me a $500 voucher for my first car.”</p></strong>

	<p>Ronzelle then talked about the employment opportunities the school provides for the city. However, there is a surprise when it comes to signing on to join the working crew.</p>
	<p>“It’s called the three-second rule,” He explained.</p>
	<p>“The three-second rule implies that any guy like me [a maintenance employee and or construction personnel] is not permitted to look directly at a Syracuse student or employee for more than three seconds.”</p>
	<p>He then went on to explain that if caught violating the three-second rule, the individual is reprimanded and may even face suspension from the job; a job that is desperately needed in an economy where the poverty rate is almost three times that of the national average.</p>
	<p>However, according to Ronzelle, poverty is not the only problem affecting Syracuse. Crime is another large proponent of the city’s inability to shake its fleas. The city of Syracuse faces a crime rate of 702.86 per 100,000, in essence for every one-hundred thousand people, almost seven-hundred and three commit crimes varying from minor infractions to federal offenses. When it comes to handling crime, the city utilizes the efforts of the Syracuse City Police Department to address the situations. On the department's website, crime reports dating back to 2018 can be viewed and it can be seen that crime has only decreased a mere 0.34% since the collection of the data. </p>
	<p>Ronzelle also explained that there is a lack of communication between the department and residents. This lack of communication makes it extremely hard for the community to band together in times of crisis and communal mourning. Especially since the most recent incident regarding the eight-year-old boy being forcefully detained. Rather than utilize the event as a way to inform and provide transparency to the community; the department “dropped the ball” and ultimately painted themselves in a very poor light.</p>
	<p>How crime is managed in Syracuse is the city is divided into thirty-two separate neighborhoods, Ronzelle resides in the Hawley-Green district. He explains just how different a neighborhood line makes in the city of Syracuse.</p>

	<p><strong>“Working as a construction employee, I’m able to go to the different neighborhoods and see what each area looks like,”</strong> He explains <strong>“Consistently, the areas where the university is are always nicer. I don’t even think the Police Department will go to the College unless it’s a shooting or something.”</p></strong>
	<p>And surprisingly, Ronzelle is correct. When looking at the department’s crime data, the neighborhoods associated with the college are absent of data. Those neighborhoods are absent from the sheet entirely.</p>

	<p>As an attendee of Syracuse University, it is easy to get caught up in the little paradise students and faculty alike find themselves in when they choose the college as their place of study. However, through Mr. Walker’s testimony, it is obvious that as perfect as this place may seem, it has its fair share of problems that need addressing.</p>
